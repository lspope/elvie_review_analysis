I contacted the Elvie team and they responded quickly with a number if reasons why and suggestions for me to try. After attempting all, it was still to no avail, they required information as proof of purchase in order to be reimbursed with a new pair of hubs. I couldn’t provide all the required documentation as my original pump was gifted to me. Honesty is really the best policy, I was 100% with the customer service reps and they opted to waive some stuff because of the situation and they sent over new hubs.

I find it incredibly disappointing that they don’t allow you to order the flange that you know will fit. I measured myself before hand and was sent two sizes that weren’t going to fit. I was told to purchase the correct size for $30 extra and essentially discard the two they sent me. For being a company by women, for women, they sure aren’t accommodating to diversity in our bodies. I expressed frustration and they offered me 10% ($3) off, what a grand gesture. Kind of pathetic since I can get a better discount from Buy Buy Baby or Target. They just seem money hungry and not at all accommodating. To make a women waste two sizes she knows won’t work and then have the only option to be spending even more on their products is pathetic. I will not recommend Elvie, they don’t seem to care about their customers or inclusivity. I’ve reached out to Willow and they were much more helpful, and I hadn’t even made a purchase with them. Being a new mom is difficult, buying a pump from a company like Elvie didn’t make the breastfeeding and pumping journey easier. I gave them two stars instead of one because the concept is great, the company is not.",2021,2021-06,2

However, I do have mixed feelings about the Elvie itself. While I appreciate the flexibility it offers by allowing me to pump in meetings, while doing chores, etc., its motors are so weak it takes 45 minutes for me to get anything close to a complete 4-5 oz. It reached the point where I was worried my milk supply was being affected, so I purchased another pump. After receiving the new pump, I pumped the next day with my new pump around the same time I would pump with my Elvie, and expressed 7.5 oz in 20 minutes. I hadn't changed anything in terms of diet, supplements, etc. I so badly want to love the Elvie, and appreciate that it is the first of its kind, so it's not going to be perfect, but it needs to be stronger and have better battery life. (I also have to charge it after every use, probably because I have to pump 45 minutes/session to get a decent amount of milk.)

Of use. I contacted customer service and they sent me 2 replacement hubs within a week! Great customer service! They asked for the malfunctioning ones to be returned & sent a label so I’m hopeful they will inspect to improve future models or identify what caused the issue with my hubs. I enjoy using the Elvie and the app is user friendly. I would recommend they look at the design of the shields as several mls. Of breast milk always spills back out after a pump session due to how the pump is designed near the flange/bottle. Overall, I really like this pump and that it’s cordless!!!",2021,2021-06,5

The pump comes with two different sizes and the smaller of the two is the one I tried and it seemed to fit based on the instructions and was comfortable/ not at all painful while using it. It was only after using it and removing it that I could see my nipple was extremely swollen and tender/ painful which lasted about 12 hours and I had to continuously ice it. When I contacted the support team I was told it may not fit properly and I’ve now had to buy a new flange for £30. I am now waiting for this to be delivered so hopefully I can make use of this extremely expensive pump that has now become even more expensive. I think it’s very poor I’ve had to shell out extra when you don’t have a choice of size when ordering the product.

I am younger (26) and didn’t want to be plugged to a wall for every pumping session. The Elvie pumps made me still be able to do everything while pumping it’s amazing!! I’ve been out to dinner/party’s and have had my pumps in and no one even knew. Meanwhile my friends had to go into another room for 20-30 minutes. These pumps are worth the money! Of all the baby gear I would say these are something I am so glad I splurged on-especially since I use them multiple times a day. I also love that I can feed my baby on one side and put a pump on the other. I have tried the Medela pump and it’s just not as convenient and I honestly get the same supply from the elvie. Another great perk is their customer service - outstanding! Every time I have ran into a minor issue and contacted them it was quickly resolved without issues. Seriously you need these pumps!

Happy to have purchased it. However, here are a few things to know. 1) it is not ready to use right out of the box. It needs to be charged and set up to the app. 2) The Elvie is not “silent”; it is quieter than most pumps but silent it is not. 3) If you’re a petite frame, wearing the pump gives a Dolly Parton silhouette. 4) The light on the pump, even when dimmed is still quite bright. 5) the pump stops before the bottle reaches full capacity. Most I can pump before the the pump automatically shuts off is 110oz out of 150oz. 6) wish they let us select the nipple shield to be included in the purchase instead of only providing the 24 and 26mm and forcing those with smaller nipples to buy the 21mm, spending more money on an already expensive pump.

It’s soo much better than my previous hand held, big, painful and loud pump!Elvie is a game changer. It’s expensive so I was really hesitant about buying it but I do think it’s worth it. Having your hands free makes life so much easier and it’s very compact. I have even had it in during social events and no one has noticed! It’s very quiet (not silent) and pain free. The only criticism I have is, if you have a large milk supply, the bottle fills up around 120-130mls then you have to change it which is a bit of a faff.

Each time it takes days to resolve the issue with customer service and for them to send replacement parts. During this time (and when the parts are in the process of dying) pumping is more stressful and your output is reduced - impacting your ability to feed your child both in the immediate and near term.Overall a great concept, but it isn’t yet developed enough.

I’ve had the pump for 5 months and experienced issues consistently. I’ve tried to persevere so many times but it’s got to the point where I’ve given up and feel other new mums need to be warned and not waste their money/time/energy like I have. It seems I’m not alone as all the other reviews talk about having issues. People only give high ratings due to their customer service. I desperately wanted this product to work and the concept is great, but the execution is very poor. It fails every single day and never ever works first time. I cannot count the amount of hours I’ve wasted trying to get it to work.Each time I have to email customer service, answer their same questions, explain that it’s NOT user error and send videos etc.Whilst they do eventually send out replacement parts, it never fixes the issues and they refuse to offer a refund as it’s a personal product. £250 is a lot of money but it’s more the stress and frustration of it not working.

Which at the end of the day is the important thing! You might get lucky and have no issues but if you don’t want to risk wasting £249 on that chance, stick with a traditional tried and tested brand recommended by your midwife and just avoid getting ‘sucked’ into Elvie - it’s not worth it.Detailed review:Often people leave reviews immediately after purchasing. This review is made a long time afterwards, which means I have the benefit of passing on how good the Elvie pump is long term (hint, it’s not!).I signed up as an early bird purchaser of the then supposedly revolutionary new Elvie hands free pump start up product when first launched. Initial orders were sent in batches and after several weeks I eventually received ours in a November 2018 batch.It had issues from day one. Two out of three of my NCT friends with babies born at the same time also had issues with their Elvie pumps (so you start to get the gist of how often problems arise with this product).I went back and forth with customer service on the issues for months and eventually, by February 2019, we had replacement parts sent out that meant it worked. By that point I was so established with breastfeeding I didn’t really need a pump though! Thus far a waste of £249 but in the drawer it went, hopefully ready for baby two.Sadly we tried for a second child but lost babies to miscarriage. Eventually our new, miracle baby was born last week! The reason I mention this is because, had we been successful and not lost other babies, we might have made the Elvie two year warranty period...As it is, this week I got the Elvie out and discovered it won’t even switch on. Customer service were quicker to respond this time but, after going through troubleshooting with them, the pump just doesn’t work anymore. They said they would be able to replace it IF it were in warranty, but it is out by just a few months. So not only did it have problems from day one, but this product doesn’t seem to last the test of time and has broken. Whether it happened inside or outside the warranty period I don’t know as we weren’t using it then, but don’t expect more than two years use of this - i.e. useless for further children unless they are born close enough together to make the warranty period if yours does break. Did I mention that it has never connected properly to the app?? It’s possible to use it without that (and that didn’t bother me too much) but worth you knowing also.I approached the founder and CEO of the company, Tania Boler, on LinkedIn to pass on my experience and suggested a rethink of the warranty period to help mothers with further children born beyond two years apart. She didn’t even bother to respond. (I’ve approached two other founder CEOs of start up products on LinkedIn previously and they gave excellent, quick responses so I feel justified in being completely disappointed with her and her company.)Don’t waste £249 on this highly likely to be faulty product that won’t last long term. Buy tried, tested and midwife recommended instead - it’s just the safer thing to do.",2021,2021-06,1

The leaking issues with the new hub are terrible, each time i use the pump it leaks to the point my bra and top are completely soaked, which means I need to change and do more washing. There is also the waste of milk.  If I am holding my daughter at the time she is also soaked down one side and I then have to change her.  Whilst one of these issues on its own may not seem so bad it is the accumulation of these issues.  Being a new mum is hard enough and the issues presented by using the Elvie are causing me more stress.Elvie customer care have agreed to send a replacement part so that the bottle securely stays in place and have also said the other issues I faced have been caused by misalignment of some of the parts caused by the way I was sterilising the parts.  Elvie agreed to replace these parts and  I have been recommended to use cold water sterilisation.  So that’s a different way I now need to sterilise Elvie parts compared to everything else I have.I requested a refund voucher I could take to Argos but Elvie customer care would not provide this until new parts were sent to see if this resolved the problem, which I am not happy with.

I was starting to lose my silly when I went back to work so I finally decided to give it a try. I got my Elvie pumps in the mail and fell in love with them! They are so comfortable, it’s nice being able to pump with freedom. It’s so much easier being able to pump while at work. About 1 month after getting my Elvie pumps one of them started making a noise. I contacted customer service and they were wonderful to work with. Elvie customer service is seriously one of the best.

Update: Since writing this review I have had a much better experience with Elvie. They've replaced the hubs and the back and forth with customer service was much more efficient. So all I can wish is that had been my experience from the start of the process.I don’t know where to start. A $500 pump that initially worked about 50% of the time and now hardly works at all. I used a hospital grade Medela pump and the Elvie occasionally up to 3 months, at 3 months with milk flow established and exclusively pumping I decided to send Medela back and use Elvie only. My milk supply dropped off a cliff, the pumps are soooo finnicky and prone to faults. They’re also not quiet, they creak terribly. I reached out to customer service about the poor pump performance and creaking. They very quickly sent me new shields (said that caused creaking - great service)! Unfortunately didn’t work and rather than a quick resolution to poor performing pumps and continued noise they KEEP sending length emails asking / suggesting multiple ways to fix the pumps - none work or apply, all the parts I am using are brand new as I bought extras. I’ve had to go out and buy a Dr Brown’s pump as a back up as I can’t use the Elvie double pumps and am at serious risk of losing milk supply and having to switch our 3 month old to 100% formula. Their customer service team also fail to appreciate that between pumping issues, and responding to their long emails people most likely have a young baby to be caring for and not a load of time on their hands to do remote troubleshooting (which is basically them stalling as pumps don’t work) I know I am not alone, there are hundreds of customers with similar issues. Just avoid.",2021,2021-06,1

The bottle/pot that collects the milk doesn't connect properly. It's so loose the button to disconnect it doesn't need to be used. When full on 2 occasions its dropped down in my bra and many other times has started leaking. It seems to be a design fault or a faulty batch perhaps? Please can someone get back to me on how I can go about gaining a replacement pump given that it is only 2 weeks old. I dont expect to have paid so much for a faulty product.

Love the elvie pump but the real star is the customer service. When one of my hubs stopped working they replaced it so fast! I’m not sure how the longevity of them will be as I am exclusively pumping (7+ times per day). A little worried since one failed within the first couple weeks but I’m hoping that was a fluke. Replacement/additional parts are pricey but are super easy to find. My only other complaint is that while they do give me a lot more mobility than a traditional pump, they will leak almost immediately if I bend over even a little. The one other competitor they have makes leak proof bags that solve this problem so perhaps Elvie could look into doing something like that.",2021,2021-05,4

I bought my elvies 3 weeks postpartum from Baby’s on Broadway with a discount. I used it several times a day on maternity leave and now at work as my only pump. I noticed a clicking sound a couple months into use. I was sterilizing the parts using a microwave sterilizer very frequently. I spoke with elvie and they immediately sent me new shields and explained to me the best ways to sterilize. Didn’t have any clicking since. After another 2 months, I noticed my output had gone down by 2 oz especially on the left and I didn’t feel as empty. I measured my nipple size and noted that it was smaller than before. I looked up the sizing info on their website but figured I’d get their expert opinion on whether or not I should buy cushions or size down to 21mm. They recommended sizing down and overnighted 21mm shields free of charge. I tried them on and they fixed the problem! They were both very quick at responding when I submitted my issue on the elvie website, helpful, and very friendly. I felt Elvie really stands by their product and genuinely cares about their customers! I also love how it’s so easy to chat with them online/email instead of waiting on the phone. The only small suggestion I could make is allowing us to choose our size while purchasing the product. Though I was definitely relieved to see that I didn’t have to measure myself before buying like I would’ve with other pumps since it seemed tedious and intimidating, I now see customizing the size on purchase would allow us to have 2 sets of pump parts/shields.",2021,2021-05,5

Then when I confirmed that it completely stopped working they overnighted me a new one. I was not expecting such speed and was prepared for it take a week to get to me.

They walked me through troubleshooting potential problems then replaced my shields and hub with no extra charge. They responded quickly and we’re incredibly helpful.

Even with power pumping, pumping every 4 hours, staying hydrated, relaxed, eating & drinking herbs etc. The elvie parts need to be replaced often.

The pump now looks like a year old, and it's hardly been used.  I think that the product should have been designed better. Furthermore, they state that this is a wearable pump, but anytime I try to do anything remotely active (such as folding laundry or putting clothes on my child), the pump leaks all over the place.  How can something that is marketed as wearable so easily leak?

I bought one pump and the curve as well. Tend to get as much in the curve as in the pump depending on time of pumping / flow etc.  Not the strongest pump, but the convenience is clear - I pump in the car, or while feeding from other breast, or doing household chores, or even while grooming horses. I haven’t used the app as haven’t needed to, so can’t comment on that.Limitations: have to be careful not to bend over or it will spill. Need to use it exactly as described or there will be leakages / problems (all resolveable). One part did warp in the microwave steriliser (though I’m pretty sure this was user error!) and Elvie responded immediately with new part.Customer service: I bought from Amazon prime and it arrived the next day. When the part warped Elvie customer service responded quickly and politely on a Sunday and shipped a new part, which I received two days later - no hassle or cost.

I love that it’s wireless and easy to use. A couple features on it could be better. The sensor is quite inaccurate. The pump is supposed to automatically stop pumping when the bottles are full but I find if I wait until then, they tend to leak. When pouring milk out of the bottles using the spout, there are leaks as well. Small issues but not great considering the price of the pump.Updated again (June 2021)- best customer service ever!

At first I was very apprehensive because of the price,  but having done enough research and comparison with the Willow which is another 3rd generation pump,  I felt Elvie met my needs and was far more an economical buy. What drew me towards Elvie was a lot of good talk about their customer service.  Once I bought it,  I was very impressed with their design and ease with which you can pump. My milk supply went up as I was able to pump more frequently,  while looking after my baby,  even while feeding my baby,  when I was socialising whether that was at home or at a restaurant and even while driving. The suction is very gentle yet strong enough to extract the milk at a fast pace. I then had a slight issue with suction at one point as it was due to my breast shield - I contacted Elvie and in no time they shipped me a new shield. After using the Hub for a couple of months,  I had a slight issue with the suction again and in no time Elvie sent me a replacement Hub. Not to say that the products are always faulty.  I think mine was a one off case,  and was resolved very effeciently by this customer care team. Their customer service is great.

They have replaced the entire pump for me and I have followed there many times consuming troubleshooting instructions with no success. I just want a refund so I can purchase a working pump. I have been relying on one that is old and also has problems. No refunds they said because there is a two year warranty and they want to keep replacing parts until it works. I have replaced them all and don’t have time to wait around for all of this. Now they are saying they can’t give me a refund because it was purchased from a retailer and not their website. 100% DO NOT recommend this pump. I am now hearing of many others with pumps that never work or only work sometimes.",2021,2021-05,1

If I’m going to be completely honest I would more than happily pay for the aftermarket parts if I could actually use the pump. Currently there is no hands-free cordless pumps that come in smaller flange sizes under 21mm and there is a market for it. I hope you have a great day thank you.,2021,2021-05,3

I have used the pumps for the past 3 months and been very impressed - they are quiet and discreet enough that I can wear the pumps when we have friends over for dinner at our house, and not feel too self-conscious. The suction is good and easily adjustable. The customer service has also been fantastic - I had an issue with a battery for one of the pumps and the replacement pump was sent out to me in under 48 hours. One of the features that I love is the auto-pause when a pump's milk collector is full. The only downside to the pump is that you need to be careful not to bend forward/backward when wearing it, as the milk will slosh against the edge and start to leak while you are pumping, which will also confuse the auto-pause and can allow the milk collector to overflow (this has happened to me a few times in the past months, but in each case would have been avoided if I had been a bit more careful about bending down while wearing the pump!). Would HIGHLY recommend and I'm feeling very confident about pumping discretely during the day at my office desk when I go back to work in a couple months' time.",2021,2021-05,5

I reached out to customer service and they said they will send me a new release button . That was over 2 weeks ago as they are back ordered and I  still have not received it. I emailed again to request a brand new hub to fix my issue ASAP and will send back my  defective hub. Customer service emailed me back responding for me to wait for the release button. Once I get this release button I have to dismantle my pump hub myself to install. They sent me a guide how to do this. I do not feel comfortable doing this. I exclusively pump for my son and to have milk lost at each pumping and having to change my shirt at every pump is Terrible. I do not recommend this pump to anyone.

This product is very expensive in comparison to other pumps on the market . I now find my self in an emergency situation awaiting shoos to open to try and purchase a new pump . Also the pump leaked everywhere yesterday as connection to the to the collect pot seems very loose . For an expensive piece of equipment to fail within the first 2 weeks of use is unacceptable. The idea is right but there actual end product needs more research . Now I need to find time to contact customer services to see what you intend to do about the device I have which does not work . I truly hope they are more reliable and helpful then the device I have .",2021,2021-05,1

I have told a couple people recently that it will end up being one of my best baby related purchases!The pros:The pump is so easy to use and maintain. Yes it has a good many parts to clean but they are so easy to assemble and disassemble that it just isn't a thing you even think about once you get a routine. The freedom and flexibility this pump gives is unbelievable. I can make phone calls, talk to a coworker, and move around all while pumping unobtrusively. It is comfortable to wear and use right in your existing nursing bra (nobody loves having to add a pumping bra). It produces milk into a very user friendly bottle system that makes transferring to bags for storage or a bottle for use a smooth and user friendly process. This pump somehow makes me feel like an empowered human being when I use it instead of a tethered milk production machine (how I feel with my traditional corded double pump).The app makes controlling your pumping session a breeze. The app tracks how much milk you have produced at every historical pumping session which I love being able to see as good feedback in case you were having production fluctuations or changes Elvie customer service is second to none. I have had a couple minor pump issues and both times I have reached out to customer service they have been so quick and definitive in providing information and a resolution. Some could list the cost as a con. I would not. This is a technologically advanced product in a novel format (one of only two cordless in pump bras on the market). You are also paying for the ingenuity on the part of this products creation as well as the technology and manufacturing required to make it exist. I hate to say it but this kind of technology, convenience, and quality comes at a cost and I think it is more than worth it!I saw a lot of reviews complaining about difficulty assembling the pump reliably. I have not experienced any problems. I also likewise have not been bothered by having to change collection bottles mid pump as they max out at 4-5 oz capacity. Realistically that is just the amount of space there is for this to still fit in bra, larger capacity would simply not fit or be feasible in the in the bra format.The cons (all minor and very worth it as a whole in my book):I have had two ""problems"" with my pump resulting in repair parts being sent to me so kind of sad to have such a new and expensive item break but neither put my pump totally out of commission so no interruptions in use and again, customer service was such a great experience that I honestly just don't mind.The app is very inaccurate in the amount of milk produced per session. I however just don't find this a problem. I use the milk volume reading to confirm I am producing during a session (It does seem to accurately report if there is nothing in the bottle) and then once finished manually update the actual totals in the app so the production tracking amounts are accurate. Easy as can be and not a big deal in my book. Elvie claims that with time and software/app updates this is something they are working on. I honestly won't care whether this gets resolved during my Elvie use time or not it is so workable of a problem to me.All in all, an easy statement to make that this pump is awesome with very few downsides. If you understand the benefits of this pump the minor draw backs come into perspective as just not a big deal! I can and do wholeheartedly recommend this pump for anyone who has the budget and need!",2021,2021-04,5

I wish I had read the other Trustpilot reviews first before shelling out £250 for this pump. It's completely unreliable. I contacted customer care to explain to them that it basically only works intermittently, can't be used in my bra because it leaks, and smells really hot when I use it, and they came back with a massive list of troubleshooting things i have to try before they will do anything, and questioned how I'm steralising...Do they realise new mums have 0 time for this!? Some days I don't get time to shower let alone spend an hour or two troubleshooting an overpriced pump that should just work! I've paid to replace shells, the silicone parts and bought spare bottles so in total I've spent over £300 on a single breast pump that is basically just a glorified night light because it doesn't actually pump. If this pump worked it would be amazing. Because the concept is great, but they just haven't got it right. I'm currently sat in bed after pumping for 20 minutes and only getting 10ml off of a now very full breast, wanting to cry because I'm so desperate for sleep and this pump isn't doing anything. Won't be buying again.",2021,2021-04,2

I have a working pump again... which is great because I do really love it.From the initial interaction, this should have been a 5-star review; however, I am now left very dissatisfied. The pumps have been leaking so much that the bottle clips were getting caked with milk. Despite my best cleaning, they both snapped. I tried to purchase new ones but could not find them anywhere so I emailed the company. They told me they would send me new ones... I was so happy and thankful. Then after 5 days, I emailed again asking for a tracking number. It was at this point I was informed that they did not have the part in stock and did not know when they would be able to have them or to ship them out. This would have been good information to communicate to me the week prior. Now I am forced to buy a new pump because I go back to work tomorrow and cannot work my long shift as a pharmacist without pumping. If it were me, I would have just taken a set of the bottle release button/bottle clip part from an existing pump and sent it to my customer.

60847ff5f9f48701fc7ca993,2 stars: Poor,GB,2021-04-24 20:30:45+00:00,"Disappointed with the Elvie Pump                                    Overall I’m disappointed with the Elvie breast pump. Expectations we’re admittedly high given the costly price point but there are several features that let it down.Critical amongst these issues, I wouldn’t say it is truly hands-free or discrete as advertised. I have to press the pump to my breast to get the correct positioning and suction; and it’s very noticeable when worn (so couldn’t really be worn in the office etc as suggested).Next, although easy to put together, one of the key components has warped in hot water and lost its shape meaning air escapes that should create a vacuum. This effects performance. Thankfully another of these components is provided so I can continue using but I expected better from what I hoped would be a quality product.The container that collects the milk could be improved with an integrated spout that would allow the milk to be poured easily into a bottle, reducing risk milk is spilled.The measuring markers also aren’t visible while pumping so it isn’t easy to tell how much you’ve expressed until the pump is removed; and the R/ L buttons appear as though the wrong way around when in use, from the mother’s perspective (looking down at the pump rather than looking directly at it - a design oversight I think).",2021,2021-04,2

I was not sure what hub it was plugged into. Emailed customer service and got a reply in the same day. They replaced everything in fear it damaged both my hubs. Also when I called them they answered the phone. It was so nice to be able to talk to someone and they knew what was going on. Then to return my defective items they provided all the packaging stuff. Best customer service I have ever come across for electronic items. Thank you! Makes buying the breast pump product so much more better.,2021,2021-04,5

I work odd & long hours in healthcare at multiple sites & streamlining my processes for pumping at work and charging/organizing my Elvie pumps & parts at home is essential to my success to continue my exclusively breast milk feeding journey. After a couple of emails, Elvie customer service was able to help me with extra USB cords (was advised to not use any but those made by Elvie) so I can be more efficient. This also takes some weight off my shoulders as I've already forgotten them at work once after a night shift and had to return after sleeping to pick them up.

I just recommended this product to someone earlier today and I would put my name behind the Elvie Double Breast Pump. I wanted a breast pump that would be able to go the distance and fit my busy lifestyle. The Elvie breast pump is easy to use and fits comfortable in my nursing bra. I was upset when one of my Hubs went out after using the pump several times but the customer support from Elvie completely made up for that. I was able to receive my new hub in a matter of days and it was not complicated at all. I use my elvie everywhere and the price is totally worth it. My insurance did not cover the pump so make sure you place this must-have item in your registry. I truly love having the double pump option over just purchasing one pump. That was a little difficult when one of my pumps went out because I couldn't always pump on time but it is also an option. Also, like the fact that customer service line doesn't take forever to reach someone as well. Overall this is truly a great product to have.",2021,2021-04,5

I’ve been exclusively pumping with an elvie pump for 6 weeks and have been in contact with customer service for one thing or another 4 times now. Thankfully their customer service is better than the product. My pumps inconsistently either make a noise and/or lose suction. I cannot pump discretely at work as it has started to make a grinding noise now (changed from a high pitched squeal it was making just this morning). Also when it is making one of these sounds, it is not maintaining  suction. I’ve tried other wireless in bra pumps and the elvie is much more comfortable and quieter when it’s working correctly (so the first few days of use), however I cannot recommend this product until they’ve worked the bugs out.",2021,2021-04,2

I would pay a lot of money for this item-if it worked. Suction is terrible and weak and you get very little milk compared to when you connect to a regular pump like Spectra. You don’t know if the breast is empty. Battery lasts for only one session. YOU HAVE TO RECHARGE EACH TIME! It leaks if you walk around or incline in any way. You’re not as mobile as you think since everything leaks if you move too much therefore wasting precious milk. You won’t know how much you’ve pumped. The numbers for the output on the app are estimates and often incorrect. You can't see the liquid in the bottle unless you take it off. The app disconnects every time you use it. It’s a horrible product- for this price and any price. You think it would be great to pump and be mobile- yes it would be but this product doesn’t accomplish that.,2021,2021-04,1

However, the following are areas for improvement:1) The packaging of the pump should be more environmentally friendly and easier to recycle.2) A service should be offered to measure nipple size for the breast shield prior to purchase or soon after so that two shields of the desired size could be sent rather than sending a shield of a size that does not suit.3) It would be better if the additional items you could purchase could add up to sets. The single pump came with two bottles but one shield - to avoid having to wash the shield more often than the bottles, I purchase the additional shield pack. However, this means I have three shields but two bottles. If I wanted to purchase additional bottles, I'd have to buy a pack of three, which would yield me five bottles but three shields (again, a mismatch). I think it would be better to be able to purchase an ""extension pack"" - a matched set of shields and bottles.4) The app is very helpful for keeping track of when I pump and what I get out, but I always have to adjust the amounts because the app never gets the ml from each breast correct - just be warned if you are trying to keep track of amounts per breast!",2021,2021-04,4

I brought and Elvie in February as I wanted more freedom when expressing. Since then I’ve had 2 replacement Hubs and endless emails to customer services. Expressing is the only way I can feed my newborn, the pump has so many flaws; it leaks (through my bra and top), the suction is weak - leaving my breast still full after a 12 min pump and one of them would cut out mid pump and not turn back on. The worse thing was the emotion stress and anxiety this pump has caused me. Every Pump became a stressful experience as I had to manage my way through the faults and the lack of suction affected my flow.I hired the hospital grade pump for 2 months at the start and wish I just kept using that, it was so efficient, I use to get loads of milk within 7mins. Since using the Elvie my milk production as reduced and I express for longer. It’s gotten to a point where if I don’t re-hire the hospital grade pump, my milk supply will be affected and I will be forced to use formula. Based on this experience, sadly I would not recommend the Elvie, it’s expensive and does not do the job, spend/invest your £250 elsewhere.

As others say the pump leaks so you can't move about much at all, and the suction is temperamental and takes so much faffing around to get it working, half the time I just give up and end up hand expressing out of desperation and swollen boobs! I have large boobs normally 34D but 36F when I'm feeding and the pump doesn't fit at all, I'd say it's accommodating up to a C cup max which is ridiculous given what it's for! All it does is suck the nipple in and out there's no massage etc so you're never going to get a good yield. You have to get it at the exact right angle to the nearest millimeter it seems to get any suction at all. It only holds 3oz before it shuts off anyway. The app is pointless because you have to keep reconnecting the pump on bluetooth so the milk flow over time is wrong as it misses feeds. One iyf the parts cracked after 3 weeks and I had to buy a new one for £30! The only plus point is it's quiet and is handy if you're on a long car journey.",2021,2021-04,2

Which means our son has to drink formula which we were trying to avoid. Elvie customer support isn't helpful because there are multiple points of failure. The design is poor and from what I can see, the problem (for us) is the connection between the pump and the collecting bottle. Someone decided the look was more importnat than the function.

Good when it works but that’s only a small percentage of the time...(I can’t actually remember the last time it worked and didn’t leak at all.) Causes way too much stress when it doesn’t work. This is my life: You have a day of calls and you need to express milk for your little one and it takes you 20mins of back and forth checking it’s working, taking it apart, putting it back togeather again, and finally it starts working but also leaking at the same time so you are then limited to what tops you can wear and you’re losing half of your milk. Then in the middle of the night you’re trying to pump. It’s dark you have to put the night light on and use the torch on your phone to see why the pump isn’t working, little one is crying as you can’t do this and feed him at the same time. So I end up having to pump before or after feeding him which is another hour of being awake meaning sometimes there is no sleep inbetween feeds by the time you have got the pump to work, and then taken milk downstairs to fridge etc, oh and leaked through another bra and PJ top. It’s not just a leaky pump it’s hours of your life which is time you don’t have when you are trying to juggle work and being a mum. It’s more lost sleep when every half an hour of sleep counts. It’s a pump you cannot rely on to get milk for your little one when you can’t be with them. If you’re pumping a little bit here and there or pumping for a night off and have days to do so then great, it looks nice and it’s more portable. If you need to rely on getting milk regularly for your little one this is not the pump to buy, which is a shame as it seems like their target audience is working mums. All I need to express is a bottle a day for 7 days a week (evening feed for hubby) and 2 bottles a day for 3 days a week (when I am working) and I cannot rely on it for that. I work in digital, I really wanted to love this pump. I’m so disappointed. And yes customer service respond and send you new parts but the parts I was first sent have not fixed the issue so weeks later I am still dealing with the above issues waiting for yet more new parts and who knows if they will work so I imagine it will be more lost sleep, more washing of bras and pjs, and more having to do full outfit changes of little one oh and then the time and headspace to actually email customer support when your sleep deprived and have a million things to do. Half the time I end up just having to hold it to my boob in desperation so it doesn’t even end up being hands free. If you have money to spend and want a pump that looks cool but is unreliable go for it. You can leave it lying around your house and take Instagram pics of it and then secretly use another pump when you actually need to express milk for your little one.",2021,2021-03,2

I purchased my Elvie on 27/01/21, it was great when it worked at first and meant I wasn’t strapped to the sofa so had a bit more freedom. I also really like the app for tracking when I expressed and the volume of milk. After just a month my Elvie began to creek very loudly when in use, I contacted customer service and they sent out a new shield and advised me they’d had issues with sterilising machines ruining the shields, so advised me to cold water sterilise or boil in water for 5 minutes - a bit annoying when the website states “Suitable for microwave, steam or cold water sterilizing methods.” A week later I then had further issues; the pump wasn’t latching, the milk monitor level kept saying it was full when it wasn’t, the unit was randomly switching off and leaking. I’ve been back and forth with customer services, who to be fair do reply very quickly and have sent replacement parts such as the seals, shields, spouts etc but I am still have issues with the Elvie, it is so temperamental and they are refusing to replace the main hub unit. A bit ridiculous when I clearly have a faulty unit and only purchased the Elvie in January and have proof of purchase!! So much for a warranty!What’s more upsetting is that I’ve had mastitis and a breast abscess that put me in hospital for a week, so expressing is absolutely crucial to my recovery (my baby can no longer breast feed). When I’m in a lot of pain and need to express ASAP the Elvie has been so unreliable and it’s so upsetting that they won’t help me any further. It’s got to the point where I’ve had to hire a pump from my hospital as the Elvie just won’t work anymore - very disappointing when I spent £250 on it and it’s now not being used because it doesn’t work!!!!",2021,2021-03,2

I have to say the Elvie Pelvic Toner is an investment, but an invaluable one!I had a total hysterectomy 2 years ago, and everything was fine until about 8 months ago. I am very active, and have a horse, but sadly it appears my pelvic organs have shifted which has resulted in urinary stress incontinence. Yes, very embarrassing!After researching on the internet, I settled for Elvie, and I have not been disappointed! It’s fun to use, and challenging, but the instant biofeedback gives you the inspiration and motivation to keep going!  I found out that I was actually squeezing and pushing down, not pulling up during my pelvic floor exercises, which is a very common mistake. I am doing the exercises 3x a day for 4 weeks as suggested, which is when improvement should be most notable. Yes, I do feel my V gets too much attention, but this is going to be worth it!!Don’t be embarrassed about pelvic health issues and take positive, fun steps to improving your life!",2021,2021-03,5

My Elvie wasn’t suctioning right and I called customer service and literally got the best customer service agent I’ve EVER had for anything- she was so quick, never interrupted me, just asked questions and I didn’t know the names for all the parts... she was so patient with me and explained everything. I told her I broke the bottle release buttons and I need to buy some and she just said no worries I will send you a replacement over night!! She sat on the phone and trouble shooter with me back and forth while I sent her videos. She was funny and witty and made me feel like I was talking to an actual person not just someone doing her job. I haven’t got out of the house at all during my maternity leave and this was honestly such a wholesome experience in itself. I felt like I was talking to a nurse or a friend. She gave me tips for output and was all around just a saint. I am so glad I chose this, my sister got the willow and has had nothing but problems and they do not sent any replacement parts to try and correct the problem.

It was expensive but I was reassured by their marketing, which implied Elvie was an ethical company that cared about improving women’s health with good quality and reliable products and that they had responsive customer service in the event of a problem.It appears I was wrong.Two weeks after my warranty ran out the Trainer broke - or rather the charging unit did. It just stopped working.I contacted customer services and they really couldn’t care less. They wouldn’t offer a repair - because it’s an intimate item. They wouldn’t offer to replace the charger (I wasn’t even asking to replace the Elvie itself, just the charger). I showed the receipt that proved it had broken two weeks out of warranty. All they would offer was a 20 percent discount to buy a brand new one. I’m not sure what their profit margins are on each unit, but I’m pretty sure that’s not the most generous offer to an existing customer to replace an expensive and faulty item, that, as I know to my cost, is likely to break again.So, my advice is to avoid the Elvie Trainer. They’re expensive, they break, and their customer service is so bad they’ve now lost me as a customer - where previously I would have recommended them. Shame.",2021,2021-02,1

I have already had surgery for stress incontinence following childbirth which was 25 years ago and now that I am approaching 60 and am a runner I am quite keen to try to keep my pelvic floor strong as I do find that I leak sometimes when I need a pee and am trying to “hold” to get to the loo so I purchased this Evie trainer to help me strengthen my pelvic floor I am never really confident that it does actually alert you each time you make a mistake when you draw up your pelvic floor and you push instead, a few times it has alerted me and obviously I concentrate hard to do properly - it would be great if when you put it inside yourself it gave a thumbs up pic to let you know it’s positioned rightMy pelvic floor is not particularly strong and I do feel disheartened when I am using if I am not having a good session and I am not reaching the targets as well as I need to It’s a shame that the app in each training session does not show different level on the screen in each training you do instead of just the one you are desperately aiming to get over - result for me in trying so hard is I feel muscles in stomach and buttocks working which is not what should be happening. If I then do concentrate on not doing that and just concentrate hard on not drawing muscle and buttock muscles too at times my little bead on the screen does not move very high which makes me feel deflated  and that the app is not working for me and I get disheartened So I think on screen Elvie should make the app more encouraging by on each exercise being able to see which level bar you are getting over if you are not able to make the targets it’s encouraging you to doIt would also be good if on each exercise that each time you use it the exercises differ from previous as each time I use on whatever level I am using the exercises are so predictable which makes it a bit boring I keep persisting with this trainer but I do think for the price it could be a little more interesting for the user  particularly by making exercises on each training session alternate and different from previous session and that there should show at least 3 levels on each exercise rather than just the target you are aiming for, particularly aiming to get above the line and the pulse I’m not being negative I’m just being honest from my personal use",2021,2021-02,3

It does give you some mobility while pumping but you still have to be walking or sitting upright. Leaning over to pick your baby up or picking up something off the floor will cause leaking. Also, the measurement feature on the app is inaccurate so you can’t stop pumping based on those measurements and since you can’t see the pumps it makes it kind of hard to know when you have enough. The battery typically last 3 sessions. The seals are a little finicky and if they are not super dry like not one drip of water they won’t suction unlike the medela. It does take longer then a regular pump session 30 mins instead of 20 min for me. Benefits include you can still hold baby abs they are very quiet.",2021,2021-02,4

This is for my second child and I really wanted to pump a lot longer than my first. I read extensively between the elvie vs willow pump and ultimately went with the elvie. Unfortunately I now regret that decision. Less than a month into my purchase one of my hubs wouldn’t turn off and I needed a replacement. Barely a month after a having a baby, with a toddler also running around no less I now have a broken hub and have to take MORE time to pump with only one hub. Customer service was great, but that does not change the inconvenience.After this my hubs have broken another 3 times, I haven’t had this even 6 months. Now I’m having the issue where it barely suctions, you think the pump is expressing bc it feels that way but nope check it a few minutes later and no milk. I don’t have the time to keep taking parts in and out 10X to get it to work. Lastly the recent replacement hub I got the button to eject the container keeps getting stuck. It’s new and it’s not corroded etc. Pros, it’s super convenient I can put it in wherever and not be hooked up to any wires. When it does work and suctions properly I get a good amount of milk. But WHEN it works is the thing to focus on bc it’s not all the time. It doesn’t work a majority of the time.Cons, doesn’t work frequently enough, too expensive for these issues to be happening, replaced my hub 3 plus times, my time is wasted.

I justified the high price tag with the thought that I would be able to use it for more than one child. Having used it for a year, I packed it away. I brought it out for my third child and it no longer works. The hub doesn’t charge and it won’t turn on. I contacted Elvie who have refused to help me as I am 5 days outside the warranty period. This doesn’t even take into account that the product was ordered online from Elvie so wouldn’t have been in my possession for at least five days after my purchase. Nor have I received any offer of a repair or replacement at all. Shocking for such an expensive product. I have asked on several occasions to have my query escalated and have been told by the advisor that they will not let me speak to anyone else.Having researched online this seems to be a common issue which is becoming more and more prevalent as this product has only been around for 2-3 years. Don’t buy this pump, it will not last more than one baby and there is no way to get it fixed when it breaks. Another piece of electrical tat into landfill, how irresponsible of Elvie. Won’t be recommending.

They are quite noisy and not easy to look after a baby whilst wearing the pumps. I also suffer the same frustration as others where the pumps don’t always have suction. However, since learning from a video about the green disks and top part of the pump needing to be dry this has solved this some what. Milk somehow ends up in the top of the pump where the green suction bit is, once cleaned it often starts working. The pumps also end up with milk all over them and I find that they get a build up of milk around the bottle release button and the inside ring. Having said all of this I use the pumps 5/6 times a day and charge stays well and they are keeping my little girl in breast milk. Just a few things it would be great it you could address.

It is very finicky, will lose suction in the middle of pumping even with dry discs, everything put together right, not to tight or loose bra, correct flange size. To get better suction have to put a paper towel behind the flange. For such an expensive pump I did expect more from it. Customer service is awesome, upon arrival I had warped valves.

My sister in law used our link that we posted to FB to buy an elvie as well. We should have received a $20 amazon gift card, but didnt. My wife called Elvie on December 4th to ask why, but they didn't help her, but simply sent her an email thanking her for her call and stating that they would get back to her. December 7th, we still hadn't heard anything or gotten any thing in the mail. So she called again and was told that our order had been cancelled since the billing address and delivery address were different. Further more the money was gone from our account but Elvie didn't send the product or attempt to notify us of the problem in any way. Instead of just shipping the product and giving us the amazon gift card they just refunded the money, which was not what we wanted. So we had to wait for elvie to go back on sale to repurchase. The sale isn't as good, so I am paying $10 more than I would have last time, plus out the gift card they should have sent me.

However, I can’t say I would have kept using them if I only had one kid or we had been working at the office like normal (not chasing an older sibling around). It’s nice to be able to walk around and not be attached. However, if you bend too far or the milk inside rocks while walking too fast it will constantly think the bottle is full and stop. If you pump at night, you have to sit straight up because of this as well. They need additional lengths of bra clips too. Some bras are too tight and others end up being too lose. I ended up resetting my bra straps to fit the Pumps without the clips, but then didn’t have as much support the remainder of the day that I would have preferred. Their items crack very easily and I ended up spending an additional $200 in replacement parts for the already very expensive pumps. Shipping was always fast, which was very helpful when items stopped working! When you do have an issue, customer service sends you extremely long PDF’s of several things to try and report back on. With two kids under three, working full time and being in a pandemic, I don’t have that much extra time to spend 2 hours reading and testing all these things. Also, despite original instructions saying you could sanitize their supplies in the steam bags. You cannot.

Finally I also purchased the elvie pump because the one I have is not wireless. My overpriced Elvie pump had two size nipples that did not fit me and the company asked me to buy the smaller size nipple because my nipple is apparently not an average size.

So I’ll begin with today.. Elvie pumps can be used on the go, this however should include a warning. “Do not shop for items on the lower shelves. Do not take your husband shopping and most certainly take a spare outfit with you if you intend to pump on the go!”.. Having dumped milk on the local boots floor, my husband ( much to his amusement) and our son ( he was the least amused ) I decided it was better ( and safer for all) to drop said pumps to the car... Now the positives.. Although the pumps are not fully silent they are silent enough to be of little bother to fellow shoppers! Having returned home it was clear to see that I most certainly had sprung a decent sized leak.. The pumps however are easy to use and once you find a setting that doesn’t leave your nipples so puckered and sore the overall experience of pumping isn’t to “painful”. Although if you have dogs I recommend pumping in a different room as the rhythmic sound of the pumps is set to have the dogs jumping up to see what’s hidden beneath their humans clothing ( elvie are definitely not large breed dog proof, Sorry Bodhi! ) If designed with some form of seal or non return valve these pumps would have received 5 stars from me. A tip for expectant mothers buying elvie pumps - consider buying a supportive sports bra rather than a breastfeeding bra as once the pumps fill up it becomes a delicate game of holding up the pumps whilst waddling to the car in a desperate bid to not dump milk over everything in a 2 foot radius..",2020,2020-12,3

I got much more milk in the same time using other pumps. And boosting my supply was what I was after. Also the pieces warped during sterilising even though the instruction manual didn’t specifically say to not use a steam steriliser. After emailing the team I was asked more questions about what had happened before being offered replacement parts and with a demanding newborn this wasn’t ideal I just needed it sorting quickly.

At the end I got my pump as an early Christmas present from my husband and it is definitely my favorite. It’s not as silent as I was expecting but doesn’t wake my baby even if she’s napping in my arms. I can pump and breastfeed at the same time and even pump when I run out to the shop.

The first month I had my pump, everything worked AMAZING and it was worth every dollar. I recommended it to a few friends and family members. After a month of use, I started to experience some issues. I emailed customer service and they responded right away. They sent some troubleshooting to follow and requested that I followed. After sending information and videos back to them, they are shipping me new parts. Customer service is AMAZING & The pump is so convenient for a working mom of two.

I have been using them for about 5 months now. I have only had one child, but I cannot imagine having a breast pump that tethers me to a wall outlet or that I could not be hands free. Purchasing was very easy and I was able to use my health insurance plan to pay for part of it. The item shipped quickly and the packaging is very nice. The one time had an issue with a pump not functioning anymore the issue was quickly resolve through the online customer service. When they could not trouble shoot it further, they me a replacement with overnight shipping so that I would not have to be without a pump for long.I have had issues with issues with no enough suction, but all of the troubleshooting tips in the help section on the website resolved the issues. I have had issues with the pumps leaking a few times and that leaves my bra soaking wet, which is not a good feeling. I don't necessarily think it lives up to the advertising ""fits in your bra, fits in your life"", since it is difficult to lean over and pick up my newborn with the pumps in because of leaking. That being said, I have worn them to work and have been able to use them comfortably, plus they are very portable. They fit easily in a tote bag or diaper bag and can be used anywhere. They are very quiet, but I can hear when the milk splashes int he tanks. The battery life is great and I usually get four or five ""pump sessions"" between charges.",2020,2020-12,4
5fdce275755dc10b4827834c,3 stars: Average,GB,2020-12-18 17:10:13+00:00,"Here's the T.....                                    So I've been using this for around 4 months now and there are a few great points and a few negative points about it. So I'm going to start with the great points:1. It's hands free! Amazing. I can't tell you how great it is to have a pump that I can just pop on and go about my day without having to sit there, holding the pump on or being tethered to a wall. It's really made going back to work a lot easier as I dont have a job where I can easily get away for a long time when I need to.2. It's quiet. Now, when they say it's 'silent', that's actually not true. You can hear it and if you're sitting in a quiet room then other people will most likely hear it too. But it's definitely much quieter than handheld pumps. Even the ones that claim to be quiet. So although I dont think they should say its silent, I do think it is a lot more discreet than any other pump I've ever used.3. It's easy to clean and put together. I've spent many a time meticulously cleaning and piecing together other pumps and let me tell you, this one has changed that drastically. It comes apart into a total of 7 pieces. 6 of those are easily thrown into some hot soapy water and then a steriliser of you need to. The main part that cant be washed can just be wiped down with plain water and a soft cloth. (I've checked with Elvie myself and they have said nothing but plain water should be used to clean this part). I do have a negative on this part but I'll explain that later...5. It's compact. I just put it in a small bag with the charger and away I go. No more cramming everything into a big bag to travel. No more leads and wires and tubes to worry about getting caught up and tangled. It's one thing. Plus the charger lead. Done.6. It shuts off automatically when you're full. Very useful since it's really easy to forget this pump is even on (if it didnt make your boob look huge! 🙈 I wear a scarf to cover it because it does look a bit weird otherwise.) But! It's very comfortable to wear once you get the hang of putting it on. Also being able to set a timer for when your pump session starts and being able to control the pump from your phone is really handy! Great feature.Now onto the bad points:1. So going back to the cleaning of the main unit. Milk does get into some nooks and crannies you cant get at with a cloth. And you will need something like a Q-tip to really get into the spaces where the screws are. It's annoying but I get that it needs screws somewhere so I clean it down at the end of each day and it doesnt take much time just to wipe over. 2. Dont. Bend. Over. It leaks if you bend too far to do anything or you maybe walk a little too fast and your bottle is almost full (found this out when I was walking home from work, maybe a little too keen to get home on time!) So... yeah. If you hate milk waste and wet clothes as much as I do, go steady and stay upright as best you can when you bend to pick things up. Think how you did during  pregnancy. The squat and grab maneuver 😂 3. The suction needs some encouragement sometimes. I dont know if I'm just not putting the shield on properly but sometimes I need to take it off and put it back on to get the suction a bit stronger? The seal needs to be perfect otherwise it wont do much of anything. Slightly annoying but it's fine.4. The battery life isnt amazing. I usually have to charge this up again in a day because it does run low fast. I usually do 4 half hour pumping sessions (1 per side) and that's just about enough. Just. But I only have 1 for both sides. So I imagine having 2 would really help with that.Overall, it's made my life so much easier and I do think my breastfeeding journey has been greatly extended thanks to this pump! I hope this helps anyone who isnt sure about investing in something so expensive.",2020,2020-12,3

I spent a lot of money on this product hoping it would be an excellent investment and result in me saving time and stress. However, the opposite was true. I nearly threw the Elvie at the wall in frustration on countless occasions.My main complaints would be:a) The shields that come with the pump are way too big meaning you have to spend extra money on buying smaller shields before you've even started. I know other people who have bought the Elvie and no-one has been able to use the shields provided and have had to spend money to purchase others. b) It leaks!!!c) It is not discrete. The light shows through your clothes and the pumping mechanism is not silent. d) The nightmare of putting the parts together...as other reviewers have said, sometimes you put the parts together and there is inexplicably no suction. The online guidance said try taking the machine apart and trying again... which you try... over and over and over again. Sometimes it would only be on the 6th attempt that the parts would randomly all start working. Not great when you are a time stretched and sleep deprived new mum.e) The cost of the replacement parts! In desperation given the money I had already spent buying the pump I bought all new internal parts. The cost of buying spare parts is more than the cost of buying an entire manual pump that works 100% of the time from other brands. f) And therefore based on all of the above, the price of the pump is absolutely ridiculous. A higher priced machine does not equal a better experience.I persevered for 15 weeks before completely giving up and resorting to a manual pump that cost less than 1/10 of the price of the Elvie and worked 100% better!

I would say the customer service team are really responsive and they do send out replacement parts quickly. The other downer is they only include 2 of the 3 nipple shield sizes with the pump and you can't choose which ones so if you have smaller nipples it's an extra £25 on top of the cost of the pump.Overall I'd recommend but if you're reliant on pumping then I'd recommend buying a cheaper backup pump as it's really frustrating when it breaks and you don't have a backup.",2020,2020-12,4

The app wasn’t very good as it was no where near accurate of milk volume so I mainly used it as a timer. A great idea and concept but they need to make the product more sustainable and not as flimsy as it is. I feel it has been made very cheaply but sold very expensive.",2020,2020-12,4

I used it 4 times. The first made my nipple bleed into the milk. I waited for it to heal and tried again. This time it was fine but the - button made it stronger and the + button made the pressure weaker.  After that I tried it twice more and no milk expressed. I wrote to Elvie for an exchange or to get my money back as £200 was a lot to pay for a lot of pain and confusion in quite a stressful time. My mum funded the pump as I had sourced everything else second hand from friends or from freecycle. They sent troubleshooting emails which I have no time to sit and work out. I just want it taken away. I still have a broken pump. A really disappointing experience.,2020,2020-12,1

I was struggling to find time to express milk as my baby would only nap for 20 minutes at a time and only if he was on me.

I initially thought it was the size of the flange so I ordered the smaller one but symptoms persisted. Ironically I was using it more often to clear the blockage but it was getting worse. GP prescribed antibiotics for mastitis.I am not sure whether it is the design of the flange being more flat than other pumps but essentially it did not work for me at all.The reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the extremely helpful and supportive customer service, which to my opinion makes all the difference in any product.

The idea for a quiet, discreet, hands-free pump is great, and using the Elvie meant that I was able to work away from home, pump in public places (such as cafes) and share the feeds with my partner. On the other hand, I experienced multiple, repeated issues with parts of the pump warping and breaking, and I found that the pump only really worked efficiently at times when I had a very full milk supply. On almost every occasion when I contacted the customer service team for advice, I found them very helpful and able to suggest things to try that alleviated (but didn't entirely fix) the various problems. But now that I am expecting another baby I am planning to invest in a new pump.

I can see why it gets to many 5* reviews but I wonder if these are left in the excitement of first using it. This is a review from someone who has used it for 11 months and it is not so excited. Don’t get me wrong, I would recommend the Elvie and I’m so glad I bought it but I would recommend it with a lot of warnings. I had enormous problems with the parts becoming misshapen when being sterilised. The very nature of the pump working requires the parts to fit perfectly which they then did not and so I had problems with noise and leakage. This is not an isolated incident. I recommended the Elvie pump to three other friends who all bought it and we all had problems with the parts. For two of us, our hubs even stopped working. Customer services could not be faulted, however and sent me MANY replacement parts (every time they needed replacing, which was fairly often). They were really lovely and posted replacements out quickly. I find it unforgivable that the warranty on the parts is 90 days (an admission of their own low-quality) when most women would aim to give their babies breast milk for at least 6 months.Also, notice how many of these reviews that are 4 and 5* mention customer services giving replacement parts...!To end on some positives, even though I had a lot of problems with my pump, I would not have been able to feed my baby with my milk for as long had I not had the Elvie. I used a Madela Swing for the last month of my pumping and I don’t think I liked it as much. I bought this though as I really feared my Elvie breaking again and having no way to express. I would recommend having a cheaper back-up.My baby had to go into hospital a couple of times in her first couple of weeks and I was able to pump wirelessly at various hospital appointments. The miracle of this cannot be underestimated. Had I not been able to do this, I would have needed to excuse myself for long periods of time to pump or otherwise suffered blockages. I really don’t think I would have been able to give my baby my milk for as long if I had been using any other pump. I didn’t like being plugged into the Madela and I didn’t like the noise. I pumped for 11 months with only switching between the Elvie and the Madela for the last month. Just be realistic and buy it with your eyes open. Be careful when sterilising it. I would not recommend just-boiled water. Also, double check the intensity of the microwave. I REALLY HOPE that Elvie have started to listen to feedback and are improving the quality of their parts and that new parts will still be compatible with the hubs that so many women have invested a lot of money into.",2020,2020-12,3

Especially if you are tying to increase milk supply, or if your like me, an exclusive pumper.Unfortunately for me I had nothing but problems with my pump. The breast shield cracked, which was replaced. Then the bottles required new parts and they were faulty which caused milk to continously leak - which was infuriating.Despite all of this. The customer service team helped with all of these problems super fast. But was annoying that it occurred in the first place. Especially due to the high cost of the pump to begin with. On the whole, I love the idea of the pump as it means you are hands free and able to move around with ease. Not only that but it is super quiet. It's a good idea but needs to be perfected and there were nothing but issues.Would I buy again? No. I would spend less money on a pump I know to work without issues.

However, it could definitely be better for the price. The concept is great but in my opinion, you can’t be as free as the advertising makes out when using it and it was still very prone to leakages with little movement. It would also often say it was full when it wasn’t.

Unfortunately my experience was customer care team was unpleasant. My promo code was not applied to my order and I emailed immediately for them to refund me the difference. The agent wanted me to provide an email of a woman from my mommy's group who pasted the promo code. Of course she did not feel comfortable giving me her email address because I'm a stranger on the internet. It's unfortunate he could see her name and confirmed the promo should've been applied but he would not and then closed my request. I will not be ordering from this company again and I'll encourage others to beware of they intend on using a promo.,2020,2020-12,2

Elvie even made an app to help you track pump sessions, milk flow, and even show you helpful videos. You can set timers which is awesome.

When I first put them on, my husband says I’m putting my armor on like iron man for the day because of the lights, which you can only see if your not covered up! This product is a life savor and I’m very happy. I got it gifted for an early Christmas present and I couldn’t be happier or excited! Before with my medela pump I would be sitting in a corner pumping, unable to move around or do much! I would definitely with no hesitation recommend this to all mothers. The only thing I would have to be honest and give a lower star review would have to be the bottles you pump in. They do shrink little by little so I will have to be calling in for some replacements.

Each expressing session consists of me handholding the device and having to adjust/reposition the Elvie on my breast every 30 to 60 seconds. To top it off it also wastes milk because it leaks!

It’s a great concept - horrible product. I am a paramedic and work busy, 48 hour shifts. When I can pump it’s important that it works without glitch. This product seems to work OK a small fraction of the time- other times I get nothing, or a few drops, despite troubleshooting etc. When I can squeeze in a pump session I need it to work. I contacted customer service and they sent me their generic troubleshoot guide which I had already done. The battery also dies incredibly fast and the milk sensors are inaccurate.

My son was born early and had trouble latching, as a result I was initially reliant on my Elvie to feed him – in his first month I was pumping 6 - 8 times a day. Unfortunately, there are a number of product limitations which mean the Elvie is not durable or powerful enough for this purpose. The most glaring flaw is the fact that, despite what the product manual says, you cannot steam sterilise the pumping parts. My breast shield warped and became unusable after using this method to clean it, and the other parts quickly became cloudy and brittle. I was sent replacements but the inconvenience of having to use cold water sterilisation and having to wait for replacements to be sent undermined the reason I bought the Elvie in the first place – for convenience, ease and peace of mind. Fortunately, over the same period I also had access to another more traditional breast pump. While not as glamourous or discreet, it was easy to use, easy to clean and above all else, reliable. Based on my experience, unfortunately, I would not recommend the Elvie to new mums.",2020,2020-12,2

However you still need to keep fairly still/a neutral upright position when wearing to prevent milk spilling out of the button and between the container and device which means activity is still limited. Far from silent. Have to disassemble and reassemble regularly before the suction will work. Disappointed that I had to buy additional “smaller nipple” parts which was a common theme among my NCT group. Container “click in” parts break easily requiring regular replacement - another common theme among my group.

I was very concerned that my supply would drastically reduce. The battery was also awful, I could charge it all night and it would die after 50 mins, meaning I wasn't able to go out for more than a couple of hours.

Initially I was really pleased with the pumps but as my expressing journey continued (I was initially expressing 8 times in 24 hours to establish milk production and then 6-7 times ongoing) I found the pumps very unreliable. Especially after washing/sterilising they would often not work, meaning I had to take them apart and put the parts back together sometimes multiple times before they started working. With heavy use, despite regular cleaning, milk got inside the electronic section of the pulp which cannot be cleaned properly. This was unhygienic and unpleasant. Also the pumps often leaves from the front, despite being position correctly in a supportive nursing bra, meaning I always had to wear breast pads and often lost milk to leakage which was frustrating. Overall I would say the  pumps are good for infrequent expressing but not for regular expressing. After 3 months I was at my wits end with the above issues and so purchased a hospital grade breast pump which, although less mobile, was far more effective and easy to clean.

Still getting used to it so perhaps things will improve but I've already noticed the following issues:- Leaky (as others have mentioned) they do tend to leak. - Find it fiddly to fit the bottle in the bottom and know if it's actually slotted in properly?

It works just as well as hospital pumps at getting milk out but much more gentle.However the negatives kind of outweigh this.Elvie advertise the components are suitable for hot and cold sterilisation, just not microwave. They're not, they're really not. The shields crack and warp at the slightest bit of heat in a steam steriliser. For me this is the worst part of it because Elvie are still recommending this method of cleaning on their website. They will replace the parts past the 90 day mark for this reason however its just one more thing you could do without worrying about as a new mum.The Elvie leaks, a lot. They say it shouldn't but it just does. Pressing the cartridge release button does it, the cartridge wiggles and doesn't seem to fit securely, and it leaks from the warped and cracked nipple shields back out towards your boob.Also don't be any other position other than vertical. You can't crack on with much while pumping because of the leaks. I sit in bed or on the sofa while nursing with it and that will be all. I wouldn't say its discreet either. If you have one you can definitely tell it's there. And if like me you've got a generous helping of boobage it's mega obvious. For the money you pay, these should be built to last and they just aren't. That's the worst part, discreet doesn't bother me.

The Elvie was nothing but a disappointment. Firstly, the machine itself is not top par. I could barely pump anything with it unless I was already engorged. It was only when I tried a different pump that I realised my fullbpumping potential. Cleaning the Elvie is very fiddly, the collection bottle is shaped in such a way that it has corners that are virtually impossible to reach. The breast shields warps at the slightest bit of heat, such as the required sterilising, and renders the machine function-less. Elvie are good at replacing them for free, but I had to stop sterilising mine in the end to save the faff. The battery life is short and once, all the buttons completely stopped working. I couldn't even turn it off or on again. I had to wait until the battery died (days when it's not being used, mere minutes when it is) to charge it and turn it on again. If look at Elvies troubleshooting page on their website  you'll see a wealth of other issues that are clearly common enough to be FAQ's.Secondly, hands-free and portable sounds better than it is. It is good if you need to tackle a task that requires minimal movement. The washing up was just about doable if you stay quite still and upright. But attempt to bend down to empty the washing machine and the milk collected will slosh out and leak everywhere. Even walking from one room to another would send the milk-a-sloshing and trigger a sensor in the pump to indicate that it's full. It would then stop pumping. I found myself only pumping while sat on the sofa with a cuppa... might as well be hooked up to the mains for some proper suction! Lastly, it is not discreet. It's quite big. If you wear one you will look very lop-sided, far too lopsided to feel care free in a summer dress in public. Putting it in your bra isn't a doddle either, your nipples must be lined up properly otherwise it won't suck effectively. This means that the notion of covertly popping it in at your desk is a fantasy.Save your money for other baby essentials and buy a cheaper pump and a pumping bra.",2020,2020-10,1

The pump is very quiet and if you use the app, you can stop it and start it from your phone. I did this often during meetings when the room went silent. You're not going to be able to go for a run with them on (the milk will spill), and you can't bend over but those are small things. You'll have to wear a jacket or something over your shirt (as they'll make you look busty and light and button on the device peek through), but that is easily fixed with a jacket or blazer.The Elvie will give you a freedom that you won't get with any other pump. It will give you back hours in your day.",2020,2020-09,5

Initially, I contemplated buying this pump due to finance but it has been so convenient. I now pump every 3 hours or so and can do it while moving. I have not had any milk spill although I tend to bend over and move a lot. I watch countless reviews before purchasing and heard about the suction. The suction on the Elvie is perfect. Originally it starts at a 4 which was too strong for me but with the help of customer care I programmed my pump to start off on the lowest suction through the app. The customer care team has been so helpful and quick to respond to all my needs. The only downside is that I have large breast and the pump makes them look even bigger. I don’t pump in public for this reason. Not a huge deal as it has given me so much freedom in not sitting in my room all day.",2020,2020-09,5

IF you are lucky enough to get any milk then as soon as you walk faster than a snails pace or bend down/reach over to get something then the milk spills all over your clothes.2. It doesn’t fit in your bra as though you can’t see it- you can definitely see it through your clothes- like, one boob is WAY bigger than the other! Not like the girl in the ad. 3.

I was initially very excited about this product because it would allow me to be “hands free” to tend to my babies. It is a great concept however it LEAKS. If bending over or if a good seal is not made between the flange and the pump it will leak into my bra. My husband and I have had to take them apart and put them back together several times to finally get good suction. Also one of my two pumps purchased together will randomly shut off. I turn it back on and it will again shut back off. After sitting for several minutes it will again allow me to turn it back on and might work. After spending so much money on this product this too is very frustrating. Customer service is poor. You can’t call them at a decent hour because they don’t have anyone in the US to contact. When asking for help via email it takes several days to get a response and then they insist you troubleshoot all the things already done. I eventually gave up on trying to get the he issue fixed or replaced. Again after spending over $400 on the two pumps I would expect this to be better service. When the pumps work its great to pump at work and at home to do things that do not require bending over. It is loud. There is a clicking noise that is audible which doesn’t bother me much but it definitely isn’t silent. Lastly the app is nice to be able to get an idea of how much is pumped but it is usually wrong saying more is pumped than is actually there which compared to other pumps isn’t really too big of a deal. The app is also nice to set a timer of how long you want to pump.

It also has a robot bright light on top so if they’ve not heard it due to background noise they will see the light which shines through two layers of clothes. The worst bit is it leaks. So although I can walk around (obviously staying upright) it leaks in to the bottom of my bra and also out the button in the middle (which detaches the milk container). So constantly having to change from a wet bra throughout the day and carry a spare T-shirt incase of a leak I can’t cover up. The suction appears hit and miss, sometimes it loses suction so you end up taking it apart and putting it back together several times until it decides to work again, which as a first time mum is stressful whilst trying to hold a baby.

I promised myself that if I established breastfeeding and got past 6 weeks I'd treat myself to an elvie pump. I've got their pelvic floor trainer which I love so hoped, despite the poor reviews, I would also love this too. I've been using it for around a month now, and despite some issues it's changed my life.My baby is now 11 weeks old and I've started to leave her with family members when necessary. It was hard to pump milk ready for being away from her, I could only do it when she was asleep and then I was stuck to the sofa and had to stop if I wanted a drink or my phone was out of reach. Elvie has given me my freedom back. I can go make a coffee, pop to the loo and see to my baby all whilst pumping. I did have an issue with my pump making a chirping noise, contacted elvie who replied within a day and after showing proof of purchase sent me a new hub. It came 1 or 2 days later, speedy. Learning how to position it so the milk transfer is effective takes some practice. I position the clear shield first and then attach the hub. I have found that as the bottle gets full if you 'slosh' it too much by moving then the sensor thinks it's full, but that's a minor issue for me and I just hit 'play' again. It can also over estimate the milk, however as I'm using stretchy nursing bras I can pull the material down and see how much I'm producing if needed. At the end of the session you can correct the amounts in the app - I believe this helps the algorithm to improve and learn but could be wrong. I have found it occasionally leaks through the bottle release button so need to contact elvie about this, however I think it's only if I bend too far forward and I'm managing it by wearing a breast pad over the front whilst it sits in my bra. It only happens occasionally. I've also sprung a leak when there hasnt been enough pressure keeping the bump against my breast, not the pumps fault. Just tightened my bra straps. In regards to the suction, I use setting 4 or 5 and can easily get 150ml of each breast in the morning. People think that more suction equals more milk, which isn't correct. If I'm not getting much off its almost aways a positional issue so I need to realign the sheild. Also, tip for more milk is to use it on your better producing side whilst baby nurses on your 'slacker' boob. Over all, I love my pump. Its made expressing easy and enjoyable. I've got myself a freezer stash of EBM which I wouldn't have had the time to do before with my hand pump. I also took it to a wedding when I was away from my baby over night - it was great nipping to the car and expressing (unfortunately my bridesmaid dress didn't have enough stretch for me to pump in public so I needed the car for privacy, there were no rooms at the venue and who wants to sit in the loo anyway). The battery lasted all day and night!I read a lot of reviews before taking the plunge with this pricey product, but after using elvie myself I can see a lot are user errors or warranty invalidation issues by buying it second hand. I love my pump so much I'll be buying a second so I can double pump when I return to work next year. Thank you Elvie!",2020,2020-08,5

I purchased this product in May 2020 as I was expecting my first child in August. The product looked amazing and I couldn’t wait to try it out thinking it would make my life easier when breastfeeding/expressing. I bought the Elvie Breast Pump from Elvie directly thinking if I had any issues I could go to them directly to sort it out. After all, their customer service for their own product should be great right?... nope! I was sorely mistaken. My son was born in July (came 3 weeks early) and two/three weeks after my child was born I started to use the Elvie breast pump. I followed all the instructions given in the booklet and online on their website. Every time I used the pump I would have an issue. It leaked, I wasn’t getting a lot of milk being expressed and the app kept telling me I had more milk than I did in the bottle. Which was frustrating in itself because when you use the elvie pump you can’t see how much milk you’re getting because it’s tucked away in your bra. This was a great selling point -  if the app worked!! Overall, it was faulty!! I kept trying to use it because I thought maybe it was just me not getting the hang of it. But two weeks further in I was still having the same issues. I gave up because I was struggling with motherhood as it was. Delivery and recovery was also a nightmare as I suffered complications from the birth and had to be hospitalised again, all while trying to establish breastfeeding/expressing and being a new mum it’s been very distressing for me. Because of this I ended up purchasing another brand of breast pump which gave me more milk, didn’t leak and worked a treat in less time. I sent an email to Elvie customer service and they were shocking. Telling me they wanted to replace parts - they leak what’s the point and the app is still going to be giving me wrong information. I requested a refund knowing from other mothers who have had the same issues managed to get a refund for the same reasons ; they are refusing me one.  This is still an ongoing issue as I have sent them several emails for them to refund me only for them to say to me I have used the product therefore cannot be returned! Well of course I have used it, that’s how I found fault with it. Others have managed to get refunded without any questions being asked. This is very upsetting and I will not be recommending this brand to anyone!! Do not buy it, there are other better products out there and companies who will treat you better with the respect you deserve.

BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL.  It is still better than traditional breast pumping.  The mobility aspect is awesome, but you still have to be careful. These have an ""auto off"" function which is meant to be triggered when the containers are full.  BUT, if you are too active and the milk sloshes around, or if you bend over too much, it'll trigger the ""full"" sensor and turn off.  There...that's it.  I never write reviews, but had to for this.

I brought my Elvie second hand from eBay, there was no way I was going to pay the crazy price a brand new one cost. I was well aware that buying second hand invalidated the warranty also. My son was born at 36 weeks so has needed expressed top ups for his weight gain, I previously had the medela swing which was excellent but I really did not enjoy being attached to tubes and tied down hence why I purchased the Elvie. Since having the Elvie I have been able to pump way more purely because I can put it on and forget about it. So it does the job in that respect.So far I have not encountered the problems I have read about warping/ poor suction/ battery issues. Whether that will happen in the future is anyone's guess. I use a cold water steriliser for the parts and I charge the pump overnight. I should point out I pump a maximum of twice a day and for a maximum of an hour each time. I would definitely not want to rely on this pump for exclusively pumping to feed my baby.Issues I have had are with the app, it's rubbish. The pump disconnects all the time, the time and date is wrong and the volume gauge is always way higher that what I've actually pumped. I also found the instructional videos a bit useless also, it would actually be helpful to see someone's boob going into the pump, like really showing how to line it up etc. I watched a few YouTube videos about the pump which were helpful so I'd recommend that. Overall I'm happy with the pump at the moment but the amount of poor reviews and consistent problems that others experience does not fill me with confidence for continued use.For anyone looking to buy this pump I would think about how you are going to use it and how reliable you need it to be. It breaks my heart to read some of the reviews that say users milk supply has dried up. Elvie really need to address the issues that are constantly happening with this pump also.",2020,2020-07,3

On the one hand it is absolutely ground breaking being able to put these pumps in and have your hands free and the mobility to do things. On the other hand there are too many things that don't work well with this product to be really worth the high price tag. Here are the things I thought could be improved: - Like other reviewers have noted the app does not always work. I never got it working with my phone. I re-installed the app, checked the security patch on my phone etc etc but just gave up in the end because who has the time to keep going back and forth with customer service when you have a newborn.- Battery life could be better. I need to charge these usually twice over a 24hr period. If you're pumping for a newborn you're likely pumping 8-12 sessions a day over a 24hr period. So this isn't ideal. - The pumps leak if you bend over with them in your bra which means you can't really do things like load or unload the dishwasher etc unless you do some deep squats. - I lost suction a few times in one of the pumps. I got a fix from customer service which helped for about a week and now the suction has gone again. I haven't even had these pumps for a month and really feel like this shouldn't happen. - The pumps also have started randomly turning themselves off after giving quite a hard squeeze on the nipple ouch! Another thing to note is that the pumps rely on the compression they get from being in your nursing bra. But of course after a while the pumps stretch the bra out so then your tension is off and you have a stretched out nursing bra. If the company were smart they would sell a bra that helps keep the perfect compression (Elvie - I'll take a 30% cut thanks). Another thing that would be useful would be a special bottle brush that can clean out the corners of the milk containers as they are VERY awkward to clean. I also found the pumps don't always completely empty my breasts but this is very personal as others have noted their production has improved with the pumps.  In summary: Wonderful to be hands free and mobile while pumping but too many annoying issues to be worth the money in my opinion.",2020,2020-05,3

My experience started off well and I loved being able to pump especially in bed at night without having to worry about holding anything, power sockets etc.Within a month of using however it started to leak and I reached out to the online customer care, who although were responsive did not seem to acknowledge that there was a real flaw with my pump. They suggested turning down the intensity when pumping (which just mean I would get no milk at all!), offered to replace the valve (there was definitely no issue with it as I had the same issues with the valve and the other collection container), and then suggested maybe my breast shield was warped.At this stage, at only a month in and with so many issues, I decided this was completely impractical and unreliable. So I have returned it to the pharmacy I bought it from for a full refund.I think this concept of the Elvie is fantastic, but there are still design flaws that need to be addressed. Maybe the next version that comes out will be superior, but for now, especially given it's price, I cannot recommend the product at all.",2020,2020-05,1

Before buying the Elvie breast pump I had read many mixed reviews on the product. I do believe that some products work well for some and not others but in my experience the Elvie has been a game changer! I absolutely love this product. I bought it when my little girl was 5 weeks old. I was extremely tired and desperate for my other half to help with the night feeds however, I found expressing a laborious activity which didn’t allow me to do anything else but sit there and express for well over an hour,  to be able to get the amount of milk required to feed my baby. I was fed up and ready to switch to formula. I then considered the Elvie. I never considered buying it before as I always thought it was far too pricey. Now I have used the products for a number of weeks I can in confidence say it is absolutely worth every penny. It’s convenient, comfortable and quick. It’s super easy to clean and assemble. I personally find this product faultless.In my research, I found that many people complained in reviews about leakage when using the pump. Everyone is different and has different experiences however, I only found that leakage occurred if I didn’t put the pump on properly which is the case with any pump.

I am a provider in an emergency dept and when I returned to work 3 months having my daughter, finding the time to pump was not only difficult but incredibly stressful. There are always patients to be seen and work to be done, scheduled breaks are just not a reality. The Elvie has made it so I can discretely pump while charting between patients and on my way to and from the hospital! My milk supply has increased as I am able to pump more often! When not at work, I find our schedules have been more flexible even as we not longer are so tethered to the feeding sessions. I can pump while getting ready, or on a way to an event, and easily transfer to a bottle to feed my daughter. I find myself working more as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The hours are long and hard. I am so grateful that among all of the stressors we healthcare providers are dealing with currently, pumping is not one of them for me. Without the Elvie pump, I really do not believe I would have been able to continue breastfeeding as long as I have. It would have been impossible with traditional pumps. Thank you so much Elvie.

After a couple of emails to iron out the issue they promptly sent me a replacement hub as they believe this would have solved the issue. I wasn’t so sure their diagnosis that the problem is because of the hub (the portion that goes on your breast) is the issue. They assumed I would have damaged it during sterilization with heat either in boiling water or in the microwave. I did not use either of these techniques so I was certain this could not be the case. They sent me a new hub anyway. The new hub came and the problem persists. So my review of the product itself is unchanged- I WILL NOT recommend this pump for this price because it’s very unreliable and has not worked for me after 30 days. I will give Elvie a 5 star for customer service and response. It was very speedy. They care enough to do right by you. The product just isn’t there yet.ORIGINAL REVIEW: As a working mom I made the investment in the Elvie and was very excited with the product at first. It delivered the promised value and helped me spend almost no time away from work for pumping. However, 4 weeks in, the suction has stopped and the pump will randomly go off even though fully charged. Tried all the recommended fixes and no its not working. I WILL NOT recommend this to anyone.

You have to charge between each pump to make sure you won't run out of power mid pump at any point.Tilt forward even slightly and you will leak Turns off at random. Sometimes a few minutes in.On occasion the suction 'bites' the nipple before it turns off. It clamps down for quite a while before letting go. It really really hurts.On the flip side at random points through the pump suction would disappear. This would happen when sitting perfectly still with the pumps firmly on. Nothing to do with movement.The app is not that accurate. It kept telling me I'd pumped loads of milk and when they'd come off there would be hardly any.OverallSuch a good idea but so flawed.It felt like they got half way there and then just said good enough and put it on the market.

Thought it would be dream come true as regular pumping instead of feeding my baby was very upsetting. Slick design and packaging, however the pump was no where near strong enough to get even 10ml. This along with the heat that comes off the motor is uncomfortable to say the least. It’s also not silent and clearly visible due to the white light on the front. Contacted Elvie but was told was that returns are not allowed due to it being an “intimate item”. Would not have purchased if I’d known the non returns policy. Don’t buy unless you’re sure this is the right product for you as it’s a lot of money to lose plus still having to buy another pump. Would only recommend Medela pumps like they use in the NHS. (Replacement parts are not what I needed at the time I just wanted my money back for something not fit for purpose) Mainly so I could buy another pump. Good reliable brands like Medela offer this.",2020,2020-01,1

The product leaks, you cant bend over, it dies after 30 minutes and has no suction. It barely produces 2oz. I contacted the company trying to get a refund but they have yet to respond. The amount of money spent on this sub par product could have gone to other things for my baby.",2020,2020-01,1

I was extremely disappointed with the Elvie breast pump after eagerly awaiting its arrival. My baby wouldn't breast feed due to spending a week in NICU and being bottle fed. I made the decision to still exclusively give him breast milk and after using a couple of traditional pumps round the clock thought that Elvie sounded like a dream being hands free. Due to he branding and the price I didn't research reviews assuming that it would be great.Unfortunately, after several attempts of trying I just could not pump half as much milk as from my other pumps. Furthermore, the product leaked if I didn't sit still. It wouldn't have been a big problem for me, but another thing that it didn't live up to that was it wasn't silent. Very luckily, as I paid through Paypal and I received a full refund - something which I understand the company won't issue if you pay directly.",2019,2019-12,1
